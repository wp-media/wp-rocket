Action Scheduler - Job Queue for WordPress

== Description ==

Action Scheduler is a scalable, traceable job queue for background processing large sets of actions in WordPress. It's specially designed to be distributed in WordPress plugins.

Action Scheduler works by triggering an action hook to run at some time in the future. Each hook can be scheduled with unique data, to allow callbacks to perform operations on that data. The hook can also be scheduled to run on one or more occasions.

Think of it like an extension to `do_action()` which adds the ability to delay and repeat a hook.

## Battle-Tested Background Processing

Every month, Action Scheduler processes millions of payments for [Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/), webhooks for [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), as well as emails and other events for a range of other plugins.

It's been seen on live sites processing queues in excess of 50,000 jobs and doing resource intensive operations, like processing payments and creating orders, at a sustained rate of over 10,000 / hour without negatively impacting normal site operations.

This is all on infrastructure and WordPress sites outside the control of the plugin author.

If your plugin needs background processing, especially of large sets of tasks, Action Scheduler can help.

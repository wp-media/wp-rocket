# Welcome to the WP Rocket GitHub Repository

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wp-media/wp-rocket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wp-media/wp-rocket)

Feel free to browse the source and keep track of our plugin's progress. You can stay informed of our latest versions via our [blog](https://wp-rocket.me/blog/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wp_rocket_profile) or via Twitter [@wp_rocket](https://twitter.com/wp_rocket).

We aim to help make the web faster, one WordPress website at a time. That’s why we created *WP Rocket*. It's a caching plugin that simplifies the process and helps decrease a website’s load time.

If you are not a developer, visit our [documentation](http://docs.wp-rocket.me/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wp_rocket_profile).

## Documentation

We are very proud of WP Rocket’s knowledge base.
We have [documentation](http://docs.wp-rocket.me/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wp_rocket_profile) in English and French.

To be able to validate your license and use the plugin, you will also have to manually define 2 constants in your wp-config.php file:

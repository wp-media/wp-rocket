# Welcome to the WP Rocket GitHub Repository

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wp-media/wp-rocket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wp-media/wp-rocket)

Feel free to browse the source and keep track of our plugin's progress. You can stay informed of our latest versions via our [blog](https://blog.wp-rocket.me/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wp_rocket_profile) or via Twitter [@wp_rocket](https://twitter.com/wp_rocket).

We aim to help make the web faster, one WordPress website at a time. That’s why we created *WP Rocket*. It's a caching plugin that simplifies the process and helps decrease a website’s load time.

If you are not a developer, visit our [documentation](http://docs.wp-rocket.me/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wp_rocket_profile).

## Documentation

Need detailed setup instructions?

We are very proud of WP Rocket’s knowledge base.
We have [documentation](http://docs.wp-rocket.me/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wp_rocket_profile) in English, French, Italian, Spanish and German.

You can also check out our [changelog](https://wp-rocket.me/changelog/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=wp_rocket_profile).

## Composer installation

You can use composer to install the plugin as a dependency:

```
composer require wp-media/wp-rocket
```

To be able to validate your license and use the plugin, you will also have to manually define 2 constants in your wp-config.php file:

- `WP_ROCKET_EMAIL` which is the email for your WP Rocket account
- `WP_ROCKET_KEY` which is your API Key
